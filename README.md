# GPS-Data-Visualization-on-Google-Earth-and-Convex-Optimization

Determing the optimal distance between two points by using a cost function to minimize the number of left turns and the number of stop signs encountered during the trip.


* Input Files/ contain 8 different set of routes where each point is marked by (latitude, longitude, angle)

* The ouput is generated as a KML (Key Markup Language) file and is plotted on Google Earth for data visualization.

* The [code](https://github.com/Aditya9517/GPS-Data-Visualization-on-Google-Earth-and-Convex-Optimization/blob/master/Bda_Project_Jayanti_AdityaKalyan.py) executes all input files to determine the best path by minimizing the cost function.
